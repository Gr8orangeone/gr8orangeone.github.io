        This is an over arching view of the projection tools and projects I have worked on. All of these are personal passion projects that have some ground in things I have seen and wanted to try and
        recreate effectively and inexpensively

        <br>
        The first is an interactive projection project that I created it uses 2 projectors and a camera to
        show  projection only where people are in relation to the projection. This was my first experience with this type of projection mapping, for this I used a software called Lightact. Using the the software
        I was able to create a large blended display using Lightact's blending and mapping tools. To mask I used a standard web cam and Lightact's built in computer vision tools to remove the background from the webcam
        video. I found this to be a fantastic first try at projection blending and mapping. I have made a change to the camera and am now using a kinect and its IR camera to get a bit better background removal.
        The next step for this would be to precisely calibrate the cameras to try and project only on people in the scene to do some basic 2d projection mapping and applying a texture to people in the space. Next
        I would like to also start to have the projection react to people in a more interactive sense instead of the current abstract.

        This second project was another 2 projector mapped display, I used Lightact again to perform the distortion and mapping. While not the best VR CAVE this proof of concept is a great example of the
        functionality of a CAVE in the MoCap space we have. I spent a number of hours fixing the distortion on the projectors to have one large 1 full wall plus 2 half walls show up properly. For content I am using
        Spout to stream 3 1920x1200 outputs to Lightact where I then combine them into one 5760x1200 canvas. From there I mapped the 2 projectors onto the canvas and output to a both projectors with a 3840x1200 output
        I learned a lot about these tools from this project and I am excited to learn even more about them. My next step is to create a plugin for Unreal and then replicate the spout system in Unity and create a plugin for
        that as well.
