    <p class="content">StorefrontVR was a VR research experience created for a client. I worked closely with 3 artists to create create this experience,
        Storefront was created to research how VR can be used to research different marketing and advertising types without the need for a full scale research store.
        For this project I was the lead on the project as well as the only programmer and interaction designer.
        I worked very closely with the client to make sure the store was designed to their exact specifications,
        as well as designing the interaction to resemble those of the model research store as closely as possible.
        There were a number of challenges along the way due to the client deciding things that they wanted added as we continually met or exceeded their expectations for the project
