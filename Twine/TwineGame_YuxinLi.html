You lit up the candle, the flickring flame makes your room seemed a lot spacious than it normally seemed. 

You have been lived in this country house for a long time, it is a fancy property but just not the best location. It is humid, rainy and mostly of the time, is surrounded by mist. It feels isolated to stay here but fortunately you have two kids keep you accompanied. 

And three servants you just hired not a while ago of course.

[[The next day...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Proceed to the piano room." tags="" position="674,318" size="100,100">Light came in between the narrow gaps of the curtain, your kids have a strange disease and they could not be exposed to lights, so you went to readjust the curtain and make sure there is no lights coming in, while complaining about your servants not doing their job.

&quot;The melody there was good, keep up with it.&quot; 
You complimented Anne for her practice, she was surprisingly attentive today.
&quot;Eh...mom?&quot;
&quot;Yes?&quot;
Following her voice, [[you look at the piano with Anne.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="The next day..." tags="" position="462,281" size="100,100">The next day while having breakfast with two kids, Anne talked about seeing a group of people living in this house. 
&quot;The former owner you mean?&quot; You asked unattentedly.
&quot;No, they are living here, the house is theirs.&quot;
Nicholas seemed a bit disturbed by Anne.
&quot;What are you talking about, it is our house.&quot; You said.
&quot;but...&quot;
&quot;Ok Anne, time for your piano practice.&quot;
For one second you thought of what Anne just said, but soon you realized that Anne had always been a naughty child, she might just wanted to scare her little brother.

[[Proceed to the piano room.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="you look at the piano with Anne." tags="" position="786,504" size="100,100">The keyboard was playing itself.

At that moment, the beautiful medoly sounded like devil&#39;s whisper, sending chills down to your spine.

&quot;Susan!&quot; You called one of your servants name but she did not come immediately.

Anne seemed to be strangely enjoying this moment but you wanted to take her out of this room but you were too scared to move.

The piano sound came to astop as the door flung open.

&quot;What happened Ms.Stewart? &quot; Susan came in, asked calmly.

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe what just happened.&quot; You stumbled down to the ground, mumbling, &quot;where is my husband, where is him...&quot;

Susan looked down to you, pitifulling watching you and Anne, asking,

[[&quot;Are you sure he is going to be back someday? to here?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="&quot;Are you sure he is going to be back someday? to here?&quot;" tags="" position="736,679" size="100,100">Ever since the piano incident, you couldn&#39;t help but thinking about what Anne said that morning.

Who else is living in this house?

Who is &quot;the others&quot;?

You asked yourself.

This house might be haunted, but you wanted to stay. 
Your husband might be back someday, you wanted to give him a house with two of your adorable kids, not a haunted one.

[[you told your servant to go to the town and get a priest here]]
[[you asked Anne what clue she might have]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="you told your servant to go to the town and get a priest here" tags="" position="547,607" size="100,100">Your servant, Susan looked at you with a pitiful look, &quot;Ms. Stewart, may be we should give them a bit space, and give the kids a little time to process &#39;this&#39;.&quot;

She turned down your request and walked away. 

[[Days later]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="you asked Anne what clue she might have" tags="" position="550,732" size="100,100">Anne looked at you with a strange look,

&quot;Mom do you really not remember anything of what happened?&quot;

What happend?

You seemed perplexed, Anne whispered, &quot;Mom you are crazy&quot; and walked away.

[[Days later]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Days later" tags="" position="321,680" size="100,100">Your husband, Charlie was suddenly back from the battleground.

He was finally back, for a while you though him died in the war, but you did not give up your hope.

Three of your servant did not seem so hospitable, and strangely, Charlie didn&#39;t seem to be happy to be back.

&quot;I need to go.&quot;
Only one night staying in this house, the first word he said to you was him wanting to leave you again.

[[Stay with me]]

[[If you really need to go...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Stay with me" tags="" position="124,732" size="100,100">He seemed to be tired and looked at you and his kids, he eventually dicided to stay.

The next day, the newspaper said the war happened a couple days ago caused severe death and injury, in the passed away soldier list, there was Charlie Stewart&#39;s name.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="If you really need to go..." tags="" position="128,562" size="100,100">I felt something was wrong, there was something wrong with your husband, your kids, your servant, your house and your life.

&quot;You should go&quot; You told your husband, &quot;just remember that we will always love you, and no matter where you are, we are right here waiting.&quot;

Your husband seemed to be relieved, he kissed you and your kids, [[left the house. ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="left the house. " tags="" position="182,420" size="100,100">Years later, the house became a popular haunted house attraction, rumour had it that anyone could visit this house but whoever wanted to stay and take over the house will be hauted by the spirate in the house. 

&quot;Rumour had it that many family wanted to buy this house but they were all scared away by her, she has been waiting for her husband returning from the war even till now.&quot; the tour guide stopped before a giant painting, said to the group of people. 

The piano voice starts again, it sounds as beautiful as it has always been.

&quot;Oh, that must be her kids.&quot;</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
