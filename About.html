        I am a Technical Designer and Prototyper  with a concentration in Games design and Interactive Media. (Graduation 05/2020)
        <br>
        My large breadth of knowledge across the technical spectrum of games is essential in my current role as a Technical Designer in the Games for Entertainment field. <br>
        My experiences in Michigan State GEL lab also include roles as a Sound Designer and Quality Assurance Tester.
        <br>
        My focus is on VR AR and other forms of Immersive games and Media. I have used my BIM and Architecture Skills to create better VR experiences by using game design to show how bim can be a powerful tool when paired with VR.
        <br>
        I also love new and weird tech that provides different experiences to what people are used and provide a sense of immersion that can go beyond a screen.
