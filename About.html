    <p class="content"> I am a senior at Michigan State University,
        studying Media and Information with a concentration in Games design and Interactive Media.
        I am a technical designer  in the Games for Entertainment. My main focus is on VR AR and other forms of immersive games and media.
        I also work as a sound designer and quality assurance tester. I have a large breadth of knowledge across the technical spectrum of games.
        I also have a background in BIM and architecture. I have used a number of my skills with architechure and bim to help create better VR expierences
        however I have also used game design to try and show how bim can be a powerful tool when paired with VR.
